# Project Steps

## 1. Define the Project Scope

- **Objective:**
  - Detect customer satisfaction trends.
  - Identify specific pain points or positive aspects in reviews.
  - Provide actionable insights to reduce churn or improve products.

- **Deliverables:**
  - Predictive models.
  - Analytical reports.
  - Interactive dashboards.

## 2. Obtain the Dataset

- **Dataset**: [515K Hotel Reviews in Europe](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jonathanoheix/sentiment-analysis-with-hotel-reviews/data).

## 3. Explore and Clean the Data

- **Data Loading:**
  - Load the dataset and identify the hotel with the most reviews for targeted analysis.
  - Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and extract relevant columns.

- **Text Preprocessing:**
  - **Lowercasing:** Convert text to lowercase.
  - **Noise Removal:** Strip special characters, numbers, URLs, and stopwords.
  - **Tokenization:** Split text into individual words.
  - **Spell Correction:** Fix typos.
  - **Lemmatization or Stemming:** Reduce words to their base forms.

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

[[Source Code]](../notebook/2_eda.ipynb)

- **Sentiment Distribution:**
  - Analyze reviewer scores and trends over time.

- **Word Frequency Analysis:**
  - Identify frequent words in positive and negative reviews.

- **Topic Modeling:**
  - Apply Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to uncover hidden topics.

- **Visualizations:**
  - Use `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for meaningful plots.

## 5. Perform Sentiment Analysis

### **Approach 1: Machine Learning Models**

[[Source Code]](../notebook/3_machine_learning.ipynb)

1. **Feature Extraction:** Generate Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) features.
2. **Modeling:**
   - Train models like Na√Øve Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, or Random Forest.
   - Evaluate using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### **Approach 2 (Optional): Large Language Models**

[[Source Code]](../notebook/4_llm_optional.ipynb)

1. **Pretrained Model:** OpenAI GPT-4o-mini.
2. **Alternative Open-source Models:** Meta LLaMA, Gemma, etc.

## 6. Error Analysis

- Review misclassified samples to identify issues such as:
  - Incorrectly labeled data.
  - Reviews that are too short to infer sentiment.
  - Ambiguous or contradictory reviews.

## 7. Extract Insights

[[Source Code]](../notebook/2_eda.ipynb)

- **Insights Summary:** Derived from EDA, including sentiment distribution and key topics.
- **Actionable Insights:** Highlight recommendations based on trends and common issues.

## 8. Present the Results

- **Visualization Tools:** Create interactive dashboards using **Power BI**:

- **Final Report:** Deliver actionable recommendations in a clear, structured format.

## 9. Deploy the Sentiment Analysis Pipeline [Future Work]

- **Cloud Deployment:** Use platforms like AWS, GCP, or Azure to deploy the model as a REST API.
- **Integration:** Incorporate the pipeline into CRM or customer feedback systems.
- **Automation:** Schedule regular analysis using cloud functions or cron jobs.

## 10. Monitor and Iterate [Future Work]

- **Monitoring:** Track model performance on incoming data.
- **Retraining:** Periodically update the model with fresh data.
- **Refinement:** Adjust based on stakeholder feedback to improve the analysis process.
