# 🏨 Hotel Review Sentiment Analysis

Gain insights into customer sentiment based on hotel reviews across Europe.

## 📄 Project Topic

Customer review sentiment analysis is a process of detecting customers' feelings after they have purchased a company's products. The company can gather this information from product reviews, feedback forms, tickets to their help center, online surveys, etc. Every company is interested in conducting customer feedback sentiment analysis since it's a secure way to determine possible reasons for customers' complaints, and to strengthen the product features that make customers happy. As a result, the business can take measures to fix the issues in a timely manner, improve the customer experience, reduce the customer churn rate, adjust marketing campaigns, and maximize profits.

To build a project on customer review sentiment analysis, you need to find an available dataset (e.g., Sentiment analysis with hotel reviews - <https://www.kaggle.com/code/jonathanoheix/sentiment-analysis-with-hotel-reviews/data>) with text data extracted from customer reviews of a certain company. Alternatively, consider parsing such data from the internet by yourself. Your task in this project is to preprocess the text data and explore it using specialized statistical and linguistic tools to identify positive, negative, and neutral experiences and, ideally, their strength and subjectivity.  Be aware of some intrinsic weaknesses of text analysis techniques. For example, they aren't always able to interpret slang words or rarely used abbreviations — or detect sarcasm.
